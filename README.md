# Caresync ðŸš€

The inspiration behind Caresync was to bridge the gap between healthcare and technology. We aimed to create a platform that seamlessly connects users and hospitals, providing efficient healthca.re solutions This project was fueled by the desire to address real-time healthcare challenges using cutting-edge technology.

Caresync is a comprehensive healthcare application designed to serve both users and hospitals. Users can access personalized dashboards to manage their health information, generate medical records from our symptoms checker, and also chat with a healthcare bot, book appointments, and stay connected with healthcare providers. Hospitals, on the other hand, benefit from a dedicated dashboard that streamlines patient management, appointment scheduling, and overall healthcare administration.

## Getting Started

To run this api to your local machine, see the steps below

1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/adedoyin-emmanuel/caresync-api
```

1. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` You will need to also clone the [Frontend Repository](https://gitlab.com/adedoyin-emmanuel/caresync) to make sure everything is connected properly. You will need to set the following `env` variables. You can install mongodb on your computer and then use the above default string. You can also use Docker and then get the connection string. You can use anything for the JWT_PRIVATE_KEY, but make sure it is secure. Make sure you get your live kit api and secret key from the [Live kit website](https://livekit.io/). You can ignore the `ELASTIC MAIL` variables. Except you want to test functionalities like mailing etc. But you will need it to make appointments on **Caresync**

- `MONGODB_URL` = mongodb://localhost/caresync
- `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` = makadabaya12344
- `LK_API_KEY` = your live kit api key
- `LK_API_SECRET` = your live kit secret
- `ELASTIC_EMAIL_API_KEY` =
- `ELASTIC_EMAIL_PASSWORD` =
- `ELASTIC_EMAIL_SMT_PORT` = 2525
- `ELASTIC_EMAIL_USERNAME` =
- `MAIL_HOST` = smtp.elasticemail.com
- `CLAUDE_AI_SECRET_KEY` =

3. You want to install the necessary application dependencies. So you need to run this command `npm install`. I'm assuming you already have node installed on your machine. If not, head on to [Node Js Website](https://nodejs.org) and install NodeJs on your computer.

4. After installing the necessary dependencies. I'm assuming you've cloned the frontend repository already. If not, head on to [Frontend Repository](https://gitlab.com/adedoyin-emmanuel/caresync)

5. After you're done with the cloning and setting up the frontend, you can run this command to start the app `npm run dev` this will start the api at `http://localhost:2800`

## How Caresync Was Built

Caresync was built using a stack of modern technologies. The front end is powered by React and Next.js, providing a robust user interface. To manage state and data, we adopted Redux and Redux Toolkit, which was a significant learning experience as it was the first time we used them for a large-scale project.

On the backend, we developed a Node.js server that utilizes Express to handle API requests. The core of the application's data management is handled by a combination of Axios for HTTP requests and Redux Toolkit Query for efficient data fetching and management.

During the development process, we encountered a few challenges, including initial setup hurdles with RTK Query and Next.js. However, we persevered, learned valuable lessons, and overcame these obstacles.

## Challenges we ran into

We faced some initial challenges, particularly in configuring and integrating Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query) with Next.js. The learning curve for this powerful tool was steep, but through perseverance and dedicated problem-solving, we successfully implemented RTK Query into our project. Additionally, handling real-time data and state management in a healthcare context presented unique challenges, which we tackled by enhancing our understanding of Redux and RTK Query.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

One of the most notable accomplishments is mastering Redux and Redux Toolkit for a significant project. This was the first time we utilized these technologies extensively, and the resulting efficient state management was a major achievement. Furthermore, we integrated a health assistant model based on GPT models into the application, offering personalized healthcare advice and information to users. This was a groundbreaking step for us, marking our first venture into this innovative field.

## What we learned

Throughout the development of Caresync, we learned invaluable lessons. Our proficiency in Redux and RTK Query improved significantly, allowing us to efficiently manage and synchronize application data. Additionally, we expanded our skills by integrating GPT-based health assistant features, opening up new opportunities in the healthcare technology sector.

Incorporating Next.js into our development stack also broadened our knowledge and empowered us to build a large-scale application with improved performance and SEO capabilities. We are proud of the expertise we gained and look forward to applying these skills in future projects.

This write-up encapsulates the journey of Caresync, highlighting the challenges we faced, the accomplishments we achieved, and the knowledge we acquired throughout the development process. We are excited to present this innovative healthcare solution and share our experiences with the world.

## What is next for Caresync?

We plan on taking Caresync to the next level by monetizing it. This way, hospitals can earn from the services they are rendering. Also, we plan on adding a feature that allows hospitals to add their staff and assign them to several appointments. That way, the user knows more about the hospital and who exactly is attending to them. Also we can take the hospital discovery to the next level. We plan to implement **Google Map** to allow users find hospitals that are around them in realtime. Also The services Caresync provides can also be added to a hospital Management System, that way, the hospital has all features in one and can reach their patients through Caresync.
